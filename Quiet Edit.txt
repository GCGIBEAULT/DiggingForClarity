Before I started Digging For Clarity, I asked myself what conservative values I actually hold. There weren’t many—and that surprised me.

I do not support abortion, but I support a woman’s right to have one. This should be decided at the state level, and I shouldn’t have to pay taxes to support it. That belief is personal, not up for debate, and I don’t dwell on it.

I want our borders—north, south, east, and west—secured as tightly as Supermax in Colorado. I want my state and federal government to pursue and deport criminals who’ve entered the U.S. illegally. That belief is also non-negotiable.

I want police to be able to do their job. I don’t want a single federal judge making decisions for all of America. That doesn’t mean I blindly support law enforcement, and it doesn’t mean I disrespect judges. It means I want everyone to stay in their lane. I stay in mine.

I voted against legalizing marijuana in my state because I didn’t trust the government to use the tax revenue as promised. Have I ever checked? No.

As for the death penalty: it needs reform, but not because I think the guilty don’t deserve it. If I could write the law, I’d allow five years of appeals. After that, no execution—but you stay in your death row cell until you meet your maker. No general population.

President Trump promised most of these things. Kamala Harris did not. So Trump got my vote. I’m a conservative, and I can live with that—but I’ll never get the tattoo. That, too, is non-negotiable.

There are probably a few other reasons, but thinking about it too much makes my head hurt. These four or five values are strong enough to sway my vote. That’s all.

My plea to you is this: ask yourself how you define your beliefs. What causes you to think the way you do? That kind of introspection changed my life for the better. A lot less noise. A lot more clarity.

We can all get along. And we should. I don’t have a single person in my life who’s there because of what they think about the big, fat beautiful bill. I slipped once—and I apologize. I only hope I caught myself in time.
