Subject: Segment Idea: Vermont’s $26M Education Freeze—Time for a GoFundMe?

Hey [Cousin’s Name],

I’ve been digging into Vermont’s federal funding situation, and I think there’s a story here that’s bigger than politics. With the Trump administration freezing $26 million in education grants, Vermont’s scrambling—and it got me thinking:

What if we launched a GoFundMe to replace the lost funds?

It’s ironic, sure. But it’s also revealing. Vermont takes in $4.2 billion in federal aid annually—nearly half our budget. That number grew from near-zero under Bernie’s long tenure. Now, with just $26M frozen, we’re gasping.

I wrote a short commentary on it (below). Would love to explore this on-air—maybe as a segment or even a call-in topic. It’s not about Bernie or Trump. It’s about Vermont’s identity, pride, and whether we’re willing to fund what we say we value.

Let me know what you think.

Commentary: Crowdfund Vermont’s Backbone

If Vermont can’t fund its own schools without federal help, maybe it’s time we try something radical: a GoFundMe. We’re short $26 million—the amount frozen by the Trump administration. That’s $87 per taxpayer. Less than a tank of gas. Less than a month of streaming services. Less than the cost of pretending we’re self-sufficient. Would Vermonters chip in? Or would we rather complain while waiting for Bernie to fix it? Under Bernie’s reign, Vermont’s federal aid ballooned from near-zero to $4.2 billion. We breathe federal money like we breathe clean air. But now the oxygen’s thinning—and we’re gasping. A GoFundMe wouldn’t just raise money. It would raise a mirror. Do we stand for our values—or just lean on them? Let’s find out.
