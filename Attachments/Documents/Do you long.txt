Do you long for simpler times
When the weight of the world
Wasn't always on your mind
Life would be easier
You could be in a baseball game
Play hide and seek until it starts to rain
You can swim all day
You can ride your bike
Be ten feet tall
Till your mama calls
Or the bugle plays
Those were the days

Do you ever wish for the perfect year
Where you forgive yourself your fate
And finally face your fears
Life would be easier
You can sing to a winters night
Tell the moon and the stars
That they were right
You can learn to laugh
You can learn to love
And tell yourself that you're enough
And believe in it
Oh, believe in it

Do you still dream

It's not so bad

Now that you are gone can I still miss you
Can I remember life the way it used to be when I
was young and 
We do what we can
You can still hold a pretty girls hand


And watch the boy
Until he becomes a man

You've had your fun
You hurt no one
Now you're on - the run
Where do you go
You don't know
You could fly but it's too slow
