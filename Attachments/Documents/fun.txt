Don't you long for the simpler timess
When the weight of the world wasn't always on your mind
You can be in a baseball game
Play hide and seek till it starts to rain
You can swim 
You can ride your bike
You can watch the clouds float by
You can pretend you're ten feet tall
When you hear your Mama call
It's getting dark
So you start to run


Your eyes are big and beautiful
And your smile lights up a room
And when you let it shine on me
It sends me to the moon
Where I can fly for you
And if you let me take you there
You can fly with me too
Come along
See for yourself
If you must
Take your time
I will always be there
Waiting for you in the sky
And I will always
See beneath your beauty
Always touch 
What you do to me
Every single day
In every single way

Your face is quite unusual
And it makes me draw a breath
