If life is forever
How come I only got one suit
And will that be 
Enough time for me
To find you
And if it really
Takes forever
I will never be free
I hope you're out there somewhere
Waiting for me

Life can be unfair
It can tear you apart
It doesn't have to let you know
Before it breaks your heart
And isn't it a pity
With your secrets safe and warm
To wake up every day and know
That you are all alone

There's a place in this world
And it's for you to go and find
Explore it all
She's searching too
She's looking everywhere for you
And if life is forever
How come my shoes are old and worn
If I walk around this world again
Don't know how long I'll be gone
I know she's out there somewhere
I know she's lonely too
It breaks my heart in half each day
Will I ever find you

Life can be your friend
It can make you wish it were
Then when all is said and done
Nothing is for sure
And isn't it a pity
With your secrets safe and warm
To wake up every day and know
That you are all alone

And then one day I saw you
Sitting on a bench
Feeding bread to birds afraid
Of everyone but you
I watched you weave your magic
The air electrified
And then you cast a spell on me
I could have never denied
You held me from a distance
Then you let me sit beside
You on your flying carpet
And you took us for a ride
We flew to the horizon
Heading toward the sun
And high above the clouds we lived
Alone with everyone
Then wouldn't you believe it
Forever let us know
It's just a word that lovers use
When they let each other go

If life is forever
How come it's gone in the blink of an eye
And all I have's this carpet left
That I don't know how to fly
And isn't it a pity
With your secrets safe and warm
To wake up every day and know
That you are all alone
In this world
