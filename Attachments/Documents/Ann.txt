The old man lay still for a long time while the woman sat quietly beside him.  Nick tended the fire while Ann sat on the floor in silence rocking her body back and forth.  
No one had spoken since they had settled him into bed.  He had remianed unconcious since he fell from his horse.  Ann looked up at the stranger just as his eyes opened wide, 
gasped for air one last time and then died.  The woman
slowly placed her hands over his eyes and closed them.  She then took a deep breath and closed her eyes.  Several moments
passed before she opened them and looked across the room at Nick.  "I'm sorry about the inconvenience," she said.  "If you don't mind 
I'll bury him in the morning and be on my way." She then kissed her father on the head and pulled the blanket over his head.  Ann's crying 
turned to a loud weep as she covered her face with her hands.  Nick made the short walk across the room and sat on the floor next to her, cradling
her head in his arms.  Time stopped but the fire continued to burn until only the red ashes offered little light and no warmth.  The young woman fell asleep.  Ann fell asleep.  
Nick got up, put his jacket on and went out the door to dig a grave.
