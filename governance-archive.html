      The Cost of Governance — Part 1: Federal Outlays and Obligations
    </h3>
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc; padding-left: 1.5em; line-height: 1.6;">
      <li><strong>Total Federal Outlays:</strong> $7.0 trillion — includes defense, Medicare, Social Security, and all discretionary spending</li>
      <li><strong>Federal Revenues:</strong> $5.2 trillion — mostly from income taxes, payroll taxes, and corporate taxes</li>
      <li><strong>Annual Deficit:</strong> $1.9 trillion — the gap between what the government spends and what it collects</li>
      <li><strong>Debt Held by the Public:</strong> $30.1 trillion — owed to investors, banks, and foreign governments</li>
      <li><strong>Total Federal Debt:</strong> $39.0 trillion — includes intragovernmental holdings like Social Security trust funds</li>
      <li><strong>Debt Ceiling:</strong> Raised to $41.1 trillion on July 4, 2025 — a temporary fix, not a structural solution</li>
      <li><strong>Interest Payments:</strong> $1.02 trillion — now one of the largest federal expenses, rivaling Medicare and Defense</li>
    </ul>
