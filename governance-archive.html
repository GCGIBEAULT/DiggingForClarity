      The Cost of Governance — Part 1: Federal Outlays and Obligations
    </h3>
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc; padding-left: 1.5em; line-height: 1.6;">
      <li><strong>Total Federal Outlays:</strong> $7.0 trillion — includes defense, Medicare, Social Security, and all discretionary spending</li>
      <li><strong>Federal Revenues:</strong> $5.2 trillion — mostly from income taxes, payroll taxes, and corporate taxes</li>
      <li><strong>Annual Deficit:</strong> $1.9 trillion — the gap between what the government spends and what it collects</li>
      <li><strong>Debt Held by the Public:</strong> $30.1 trillion — owed to investors, banks, and foreign governments</li>
      <li><strong>Total Federal Debt:</strong> $39.0 trillion — includes intragovernmental holdings like Social Security trust funds</li>
      <li><strong>Debt Ceiling:</strong> Raised to $41.1 trillion on July 4, 2025 — a temporary fix, not a structural solution</li>
      <li><strong>Interest Payments:</strong> $1.02 trillion — now one of the largest federal expenses, rivaling Medicare and Defense</li>

    The Cost of Governance — Part 2: The Fiscal Squeeze
  </h3>
  <ul style="list-style-type: disc; padding-left: 1.5em; line-height: 1.6;">
    <li>
      <strong>Debt vs. GDP:</strong> The U.S. now owes about 98% of what it produces in a year. GDP is the total value of everything the economy makes—goods, services, investments. When debt nearly equals that, it signals we’re stretched thin.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Interest Payments:</strong> The government spent $1.02 trillion just on interest this year. That’s money that doesn’t build roads, fund research, or help veterans—it just keeps the debt from growing faster.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Crowding Out:</strong> As interest costs rise, there’s less room for new ideas. Infrastructure, education, and emergency response all get squeezed. The budget becomes a list of obligations, not opportunities.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Rate Risk:</strong> Every 1% rise in interest rates adds roughly $390 billion in new cost. That’s the price of borrowing when the debt is already maxed out.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Political Gridlock:</strong> Lawmakers keep raising the debt ceiling but avoid the hard fixes. The ceiling isn’t a solution—it’s a ritual. And every time it’s raised, the squeeze gets tighter.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3 style="color:#003366;">The Cost of Governance — The Price of Inaction</h3>
  <ul style="padding-left: 1.5em; font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.6;">
    <li style="color:#cc0000;"><strong>Congress:</strong> Lawmakers continue receiving full salaries due to constitutional protections—even during shutdown.</li>
    <li>
      <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/us-military-service-members-aren-t-paid-during-government-shutdown-most-va-services-not-impacted/ar-AA1NBXLd" target="_blank" style="color:#003366; text-decoration: none;">
        <strong>Military: No Pay During Shutdown</strong>
      </a>
      All active-duty service members, National Guard, and reservists must report for duty but will not receive pay until federal funding resumes. Civilian support staff are furloughed unless deemed essential.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Social Security & Medicare:</strong> Benefits continue uninterrupted, funded by permanent appropriations.</li>
    <li><strong>VA Hospitals:</strong> Veterans retain access to emergency and walk-in care at VA facilities.</li>
    <li><strong>Federal Employees:</strong> Non-essential staff are furloughed without pay; essential staff must work unpaid until funding resumes.</li>
    <li><strong>Federal Contractors:</strong> Often receive no pay and no back pay—contract law doesn’t guarantee reimbursement.</li>
    <li><strong>Air Traffic Control & TSA:</strong> Stay on duty without pay; delays possible if sick-outs increase.</li>
    <li><strong>SNAP & TANF:</strong> Food assistance continues under mandatory spending, but TANF may pause if states can’t cover the gap. Extended shutdowns risk delays.</li>
    <li><strong>WIC:</strong> Emergency food aid for women and infants may run out within days. Clinics face closure if Congress doesn’t act.</li>
    <li><strong>Medicaid:</strong> Coverage may be impacted if Congress fails to reverse recent cuts—especially for low-income families.</li>
    <li><strong>Hospitals:</strong> Remain open, but uninsured patients may face delays or denials if Medicaid access stalls.</li>
  </ul>
  <p style="font-size: 0.9em; color: #666;">Shutdown begins October 1, 2025. This block will update daily until funding resumes.</p>
