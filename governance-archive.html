      The Cost of Governance — Part 1: Federal Outlays and Obligations
    </h3>
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc; padding-left: 1.5em; line-height: 1.6;">
      <li><strong>Total Federal Outlays:</strong> $7.0 trillion — includes defense, Medicare, Social Security, and all discretionary spending</li>
      <li><strong>Federal Revenues:</strong> $5.2 trillion — mostly from income taxes, payroll taxes, and corporate taxes</li>
      <li><strong>Annual Deficit:</strong> $1.9 trillion — the gap between what the government spends and what it collects</li>
      <li><strong>Debt Held by the Public:</strong> $30.1 trillion — owed to investors, banks, and foreign governments</li>
      <li><strong>Total Federal Debt:</strong> $39.0 trillion — includes intragovernmental holdings like Social Security trust funds</li>
      <li><strong>Debt Ceiling:</strong> Raised to $41.1 trillion on July 4, 2025 — a temporary fix, not a structural solution</li>
      <li><strong>Interest Payments:</strong> $1.02 trillion — now one of the largest federal expenses, rivaling Medicare and Defense</li>

    The Cost of Governance — Part 2: The Fiscal Squeeze
  </h3>
  <ul style="list-style-type: disc; padding-left: 1.5em; line-height: 1.6;">
    <li>
      <strong>Debt vs. GDP:</strong> The U.S. now owes about 98% of what it produces in a year. GDP is the total value of everything the economy makes—goods, services, investments. When debt nearly equals that, it signals we’re stretched thin.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Interest Payments:</strong> The government spent $1.02 trillion just on interest this year. That’s money that doesn’t build roads, fund research, or help veterans—it just keeps the debt from growing faster.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Crowding Out:</strong> As interest costs rise, there’s less room for new ideas. Infrastructure, education, and emergency response all get squeezed. The budget becomes a list of obligations, not opportunities.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Rate Risk:</strong> Every 1% rise in interest rates adds roughly $390 billion in new cost. That’s the price of borrowing when the debt is already maxed out.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Political Gridlock:</strong> Lawmakers keep raising the debt ceiling but avoid the hard fixes. The ceiling isn’t a solution—it’s a ritual. And every time it’s raised, the squeeze gets tighter.
    </li>
