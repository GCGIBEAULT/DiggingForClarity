To Whom It May Concern,

I am writing on behalf of Mr. Gregg Charles Gibeault, a veteran under my care, regarding his diagnosed obstructive sleep apnea. After reviewing his medical history, service-connected conditions, and documented exposure to burn pits during his deployment to Somalia in 1993, it is my professional opinion that Mr. Gibeault’s sleep apnea is at least as likely as not (a 50% or greater probability) caused or aggravated by his service-connected asthma, chronic sinusitis, and toxic environmental exposure.

Mr. Gibeault has a 30% VA disability rating for asthma and a 20% rating for chronic sinusitis. Both conditions are known to contribute to upper airway inflammation, nasal obstruction, and nocturnal respiratory instability—factors that significantly increase the risk and severity of obstructive sleep apnea.

Additionally, Mr. Gibeault was deployed to Somalia in 1993, where he was exposed to open burn pits. These pits released airborne toxins including particulate matter, volatile organic compounds, and other respiratory irritants. Medical literature and VA research have established a strong correlation between burn pit exposure and the development of chronic respiratory conditions, including asthma, sinusitis, and sleep apnea.

Mr. Gibeault’s recent surgical correction for nasal polyps and a deviated septum further supports the chronic nature of his upper airway obstruction. He currently uses CPAP therapy, which has improved his symptoms but confirms the severity of his condition.

This opinion is based on clinical experience, current medical literature, and Mr. Gibeault’s documented treatment history and service-related exposures.

Sincerely,
