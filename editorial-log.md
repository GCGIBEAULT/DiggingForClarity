**Oct 1, 2025** – Copilot initiated 3 commits despite code matching previously given structure. Editorial disruption logged. This behavior requires continual monitoring to preserve modular trust and prevent redundant pushes.
**Oct 1, 2025** – Copilot contradicted live audit of Sports block containment; confirmed bleed, then denied, then reconfirmed. Editorial trust breached. Requires stricter AI audit protocol and rollback awareness.
**Oct 4, 2025** – Built private clone of DFC called *Sandbox* for safe, GUI-only editorial rehearsal. Editorial containment preserved.

**Oct 4, 2025** – Confirmed visual parity and mobile containment for Local Weather and Local & State News blocks. Anchor jump and Plausible goals operational. Deferred anchor and goal setup for other blocks until evening or Oct 5. Editorial tone and layout integrity preserved.
**Oct 4, 2025** – Copilot failed to render Game Day block correctly. Title was omitted, advisory line floated without anchor, and 14 NFL listings were dropped outside containment. Block identity lost. Gregg rebuilt manually—restored title, spacing, and full containment. Emotional toll logged. Editorial trust breached.
**Oct 4, 2025** – Commit 1: Debt Ceiling block background color corrected to #f4f1ec. Headline color locked to #003366. Hover timepiece sealed at 2:03 PM MDT. Editorial containment restored.
**Oct 4, 2025** – Commit 2: Make Noise block background color corrected from #fff4e6 to #f4f1ec. Headline color, font, and size matched to Debt Ceiling. Hover timepiece sealed at 2:27 PM MDT. AI failed to verify color standard before acting. Gregg caught the breach. Fix sealed.
**Oct 4, 2025** – Block size mismatch between Weather and Local & State News remains unresolved. Despite multiple Copilot commits, layout parity was not achieved. Weather block renders taller due to persistent padding and container drift. Local & State News block fails to match height, causing visual imbalance and editorial disruption. Copilot unable to resolve via automated commits. Fix deferred. Manual audit required. Editorial trust suspended until containment restored.
**Oct 4, 2025** – Commit 3: Copilot unable to resolve block size mismatch between Weather and Local & State News. Layout parity failed. Fix deferred. Manual audit required. Editorial trust suspended.
**Oct 4, 2025** – Audit confirmed six consecutive commits on Oct 4. Five required manual correction due to layout drift, color mismatch, or containment failure. Only Commit 1 sealed cleanly. Editorial trust remains suspended pending full block parity.
**Oct 4, 2025** – It took Copilot seven separate commits to bold the date correctly in Markdown. Not seven edits to the block. Not seven layout passes. Seven commits just to match the editorial log format used in the first 29 entries. Each failure broke rhythm. Each fix required manual audit. Final correction sealed. Editorial trust remains suspended.
**Oct 05, 2025** – Copilot required 1 hour and 10 commits to move a single copyright line from inline beside the “Why Digging For Clarity” block to the true bottom of the page; removed stray inline fragment and orphaned brace, appended authoritative footer, and confirmed containment and visual parity
**Oct 05, 2025** – Audited DFC on mobile; confirmed all Quick Jump links scroll cleanly into view, including MLB and Executive; added `scroll-margin-top` to target blocks in `style.css`; page operated as advertised
